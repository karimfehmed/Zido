    <div class="about-para">
      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>
        Zido is an online auction platform. The name “Zido” is derived from the
        Arabic word “Mazad” which means “Auction”. So basically what we did in
        this new platform is that we created a tool to make auctions more easier
        and fun. And to make sure we solve the unserious bidders issue we
        created Zido Points mechanism which allows sellers to filter out those
        who just bid and never buy. In Zido you can sell your item in public
        auction or in the new feature Zido created “Zido Private Auction Rooms”
        which basically gives you the ability to create a room, list items,
        invite people (your friends, your family, your coworkers, or any certain
        group of people who you think will be interested in what you’re selling)
        and you can receive their bids in that room.
      </p>
      <h2>Who we are?</h2>
      <p>
        Zido is a digital platform connecting buyers and sellers through a
        robust system specifically designed to ease an auction for both parties.
        Whether it's selling a car or buying one, we aim to make this an easy
        and pleasurable experience for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        We recognize the difficulty nowadays in finding a trustworthy buyer or
        seller which is why we came up with the idea of Zido. Zido addresses two
        main factors, a dedicated auctioning system along wth our feedback
        system. Both factors were considered when building this system which in
        turn gives the customer the ease of mind when finding a potential buyer
        or seller. In addition, our filtering system allows a user to seamlessly
        find the type of product he or she is looking for without the hassle of
        endless results.
      </p>
      <p>
        We value feedback of whether buyers or sellers as it is the number one
        priority of a customer when choosing either to buy from a particular
        person or sell to him/her.
      </p>
