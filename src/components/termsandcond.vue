      <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
      <h2>Updated: March 30, 2019 (Effective as of November 30, 2018)</h2>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Zido (the "Zido platform", "Zido marketplace", "Zido App",
        "tryZido.com", "Zido.com.sa", "Zido.app"), owned and operated by Zido
        Inc. By accessing Zido you agree to the following Terms of Use. These
        Terms of Use are effective as of November 30, 2018.
      </p>

      <h2>General</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms and the other policies published on Zido platform constitute
        the entire agreement between Zido platform and you. This agreement is
        governed by the laws of Saudi Arabia as it applies to contracts that are
        concluded in Saudi Arabia that are fully concluded between Saudi Arabian
        residents, without regard to conflict of law rules. You agree that any
        claims or disputes you may have against Zido Inc. must be settled by a
        court in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. If we do not enforce any specific
        provision, we will not waive our right to do so later. If a court meets
        one of these conditions, the remaining provisions are retained. We may,
        at our sole discretion, automatically assign this Agreement in
        accordance with the terms below. All legal notices will be sent to us by
        the national registered representative of Zido Inc., except for the
        reporting of policy violations and intellectual property infringements.
        We will send you notifications via the e-mail address provided by you or
        by registered letter to the address given by you. Notifications sent by
        registered e-mail will be considered received 5 days after the date of
        shipment. We may update these terms at any time, with the updates
        effective 30 days after they are first published on the Site. Other
        changes to these terms and conditions will only be effective if signed
        in writing by the users and us.
      </p>

        contents of These Terms of Use with any other terms of the Zido
        platform, or between the English and other language versions of this
        policy, the English version and the decision of Zido.app exercised in
        its absolute discretion shall always prevail.
